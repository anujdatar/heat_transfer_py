# README #

Just a basic python application to calculate heat transfer in selective laser sintering.

    - Simulate different laser tool-paths and their thermal effects on substrates
    - Find optimal tool-paths

### What is this repository for? ###

* __Summary__: Still in Alpha
    - Tool to simulate heat transfer in a laser based process - currently for a 2D substrate irridiated by a moving point heat source.
* __Version__ 0.1.2: added GUI 
    - __Version__ 0.1: was coded in matlab
    - __Version__ 0.1.1: moved to python
* [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)


### How do I get set up? ###

* __Configuration__:
    - Changes can be made in the GUI now
    - for the command line version - Material properties can be viewed in the **Materials** folder. You can add more materials here, but you will have to update the **__init__.py** file to be able to import the properties. Use standard python package guidelines
* __Dependencies__:
    - You will need **ffmpeg** for running the animation generation scrypts
    - Tkinter (Tk) for GUI


### Contribution guidelines ###

* __Writing tests__:
    - Work in progress. have small tests written. working on the major stuff
* Code review
